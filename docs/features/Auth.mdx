# Auth

The authentication module makes use of `next-auth` to provide authentication for your application.
NextAuth is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It allows us to make the server be aware
of the user session and provide us with a session object that we can use to check if the user is authenticated or not.

The module makes the assumption that the backend is a Laravel backend with a password grant client configured.

## Research

We couldn't make Laravel Sanctum work with NextAuth, so we decided to use Laravel Passport instead. Passport is a more
complete solution for authentication and it's easier to integrate with NextAuth.
