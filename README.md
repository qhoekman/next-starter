## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

```sh
npx degit git@bitbucket.org:deinternetjongens/frontend-next-starter.git --mode=git <project-name>
cd <project-name>
npm install
```

Configure the `.env` file with the correct values, e.g. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT` needs to be set to the correct API endpoint.

The starter-kit is equipped with authentication and a example feature which can be used as a starting point for your project. To remove these run:

```sh

npm run gen cleanup

```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To start the development server run:

```sh

npm run dev

```

> This will start the dev server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

```sh

npm run sb:dev

```

> This will start the storybook server on [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

## üçø Generators

This project comes with a few generators to help you create a new component, page, hook or feature. You can run these generators by running:

```sh

npm run gen

```

The generator will ask you a few questions and then create the files for you.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

The tests can be run for the entire project using:

```sh
npm run cy:open
```

> This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select which tests to run.

```sh
npm run cy:run

```

> This will run all tests in the terminal.

```sh
npm run cy:run:ct

```

> This will run all component tests in the terminal.

```sh
npm run cy:run:e2e

```

> This will run all end to end tests in the terminal.

## ‚òùÔ∏è Updates from starter-kit

To get updates from the starter-kit we make use of git remotes. To add the starter-kit as a remote run:

```sh

git remote add starter git@bitbucket.org:deinternetjongens/frontend-next-starter.git

```

To get the latest updates from the starter-kit run:

```sh

git pull starter main  --allow-unrelated-histories

```

## üîë SSL setup

To run the project with SSL, you need to generate a certificate for localhost. You can do this by running the following commands:

```sh

brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost

```

This will create a certifcate in the current directory which will be used by the dev server. You can now run the dev server with SSL by running:

```sh

npm run dev:ssl

```

> This will start the dev server on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

You may only need this setup if the backend is runnin on a external domain over HTTPS and has CORS enabled with a secure cookie.
